--- abstract

This document specifies a number of algorithms that may be used to encode or hash an
arbitrary string to a point on an elliptic curve.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Many cryptographic protocols require a procedure that encodes an arbitrary input,
e.g., a password, to a point on an elliptic curve. This procedure is known
as hashing to an elliptic curve. Prominent examples of cryptosystems that
hash to elliptic curves include Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange
{{J96}}, Password Authenticated Key Exchange {{BMP00}}, Identity-Based
Encryption {{BF01}} and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures {{BLS01}}.

Unfortunately for implementors, the precise hash function that is suitable for a
given scheme is not necessarily included in the description of the protocol.
Compounding this problem is the need to pick a suitable curve for the specific
protocol.

This document aims to bridge this gap by providing a thorough set of
recommended algorithms for a range of curve types.
Each algorithm conforms to a common interface: it takes as input an arbitrary-length
bit string and produces as output a point on an elliptic curve.
We provide implementation details for each algorithm, describe
the security rationale behind each recommendation, and give guidance for
elliptic curves that are not explicitly covered.

This document does not cover rejection sampling methods, sometimes known
as "try-and-increment" or "hunt-and-peck," because the goal is to describe
algorithms that can plausibly be made constant time. Use of these rejection
methods is NOT RECOMMENDED, because they have been a perennial cause of
side-channel vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

# Background {#background}

## Elliptic curves {#bg-curves}

The following is a brief definition of elliptic curves, with an emphasis on
important parameters and their relation to hashing to curves.
For further reference on elliptic curves, consult {{CFADLNV05}} or {{W08}}.

Let F be the finite field GF(q) of prime characteristic p. In most cases F
is a prime field, so q = p. Otherwise, F is a field extension, so q = p^m for
an integer m > 1. This document assumes that elements of field extensions
are written in a primitive element or polynomial basis, i.e., as
of m elements of GF(p) written in ascending order
by degree. For example, if q = p^2 and the primitive element basis is {1, i},
then the vector (a, b) corresponds to the element a + b * i.

An elliptic curve E is specified by an equation in two variables and a
finite field F. An elliptic curve equation takes one of several standard forms,
including (but not limited to) Weierstrass, Montgomery, and Edwards.

The curve E induces an algebraic group whose elements are those points
with coordinates (x, y) satisfying the curve equation, and where x and y
are elements of F.
This group has order n, meaning that there are n distinct points.
This document uses additive notation for the elliptic curve group operation.

For security reasons, groups of prime order MUST be used. Elliptic curves
induce subgroups of prime order. Let G be a subgroup of the curve of prime
order r, where n = h * r.
In this equation, h is an integer called the cofactor.
An algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary point on the curve E and
produces as output a point in the subgroup G of E is said to "clear
the cofactor."
Such algorithms are discussed in {{cofactor-clearing}}.

Certain hash-to-curve algorithms restrict the form of the curve equation, the
characteristic of the field, and/or the parameters of the curve. For each
algorithm presented, this document lists the relevant restrictions.

Summary of quantities:

| Symbol | Meaning | Relevance |
|:------:|---------|-----------|
| F,q,p | Finite field F of characteristic p and #F = q = p^m. | For prime fields, q = p; otherwise, q = p^m and m>1. |
| E | Elliptic curve. | E is specified by an equation and a field F. |
| n | Number of points on the elliptic curve E. | n = h * r, for h and r defined below. |
| G | A subgroup of the elliptic curve. | Destination group to which bit strings are encoded. |
| r | Order of G. | This number MUST be prime.  |
| h | Cofactor, h >= 1. | An integer satisfying n = h * r.  |

## Terminology

In this section, we define important terms used in the rest of this document.

### Mappings {#term-mapping}

A mapping is a deterministic function from an element of the field F to a point
on an elliptic curve E defined over F.

In general, the set of all points that a mapping can produce over all
possible inputs may be only a subset of the points on an elliptic curve
(i.e., the mapping may not be surjective).
In addition, a mapping may output the same point for two or more distinct inputs
(i.e., the mapping may not be injective).
For example, consider a mapping from F to an elliptic curve having n points:
if the number of elements of F is not equal to n,
then this mapping cannot be bijective (i.e., both injective and surjective)
since it is defined to be deterministic.

Mappings may also be invertible, meaning that there is an efficient algorithm
that, for any point P output by the mapping, outputs an x in F such that
applying the mapping to x outputs P.
Some of the mappings given in {{mappings}} are invertible, but this
document does not discuss inversion algorithms.

### Encodings {#term-encoding}

Encodings are closely related to mappings.
Like a mapping, an encoding is a function that outputs a point on an elliptic curve.
In contrast to a mapping, however, the input to an encoding is an arbitrary bit string.
Encodings can be deterministic or probabilistic.
Deterministic encodings are preferred for security, because probabilistic
ones can leak information through side channels.

This document constructs deterministic encodings by composing a hash function H
with a deterministic mapping.
In particular, H takes as input an arbitrary bit string and outputs an element of F.
The deterministic mapping takes that element as input and outputs a point on an
elliptic curve E defined over F.
Since the hash function H takes arbitrary bit strings as inputs, it cannot be
injective: the set of inputs is larger than the set of outputs, so there must
be distinct inputs that give the same output (i.e., there must be collisions).
Thus, any encoding built from H is also not injective.

Like mappings, encodings may be invertible, meaning that there is an efficient
algorithm that, for any point P output by the encoding, outputs a bit string s
such that applying the encoding to s outputs P.
The hash function used by all encodings specified in this document ({{hashtobase}})
is not invertible; thus, the encodings are also not invertible.

### Random oracle encodings {#term-rom}

Two different types of encodings are possible: nonuniform encodings,
whose output distribution is not uniformly random, and random oracle encodings,
whose output distribution is indistinguishable from uniformly random.
Some protocols require a random oracle for security, while others can
be securely instantiated with a nonuniform encoding.
When the required encoding is not clear, applications SHOULD use a random oracle.

Care is required when constructing a random oracle from a mapping function.
A simple but insecure approach is to use the output of a cryptographically
secure hash function H as the input to the mapping.
Because in general the mapping is not surjective, the output of this
construction is distinguishable from uniformly random, i.e., it does
not behave like a random oracle.

Brier et al. {{BCIMRT10}} describe two generic constructions whose outputs are
indifferentiable from a random oracle when the constructions are instantiated
with appropriate hash functions modeled as random oracles.
Farashahi et al. {{FFSTV13}} and Tibouchi and Kim {{TK17}} refine the analysis
of one of these constructions.
That construction is described in {{roadmap}}.

### Serialization {#term-serialization}

A procedure related to encoding is the conversion of an elliptic curve point to a bit string.
This is called serialization, and is typically used for compactly storing or transmitting points.
For example, {{SECG1}} gives a standard method for serializing points.
The reverse operation, deserialization, converts a bit string to an elliptic
curve point.

Deserialization is different from encoding in that only certain strings
(namely, those output by the serialization procedure) can be deserialized.
In contrast, this document is concerned with encodings from arbitrary bit strings
to elliptic curve points.
This document does not cover serialization or deserialization.

### Domain separation {#term-domain-separation}

Cryptographic protocols that use random oracles are often analyzed
under the assumption that random oracles answer only queries generated
by that protocol.
In practice, this assumption does not hold if two protocols query the
same random oracle.
Concretely, consider protocols P1 and P2 that query random oracle R:
if P1 and P2 both query R on the same value x, the security analysis of
one or both protocols may be invalidated.

A common approach to addressing this issue is called domain separation,
which allows a single random oracle to simulate multiple, independent oracles.
This is effected by ensuring that each simulated oracle sees queries that are
distinct from those seen by all other simulated oracles.
For example, to simulate two oracles R1 and R2 given a single oracle R,
one might define

    R1(x) := R("R1" || x)
    R2(x) := R("R2" || x)

In this example, "R1" and "R2" are called domain separation tags;
they ensure that queries to R1 and R2 cannot result in identical
queries to R.
Thus, it is safe to treat R1 and R2 as independent oracles.

# Roadmap {#roadmap}

This section presents a general framework for encoding bit strings to points
on an elliptic curve. To construct these encodings, we rely on three basic
functions:

-   The function hash\_to\_base, {0, 1}^\* x {0, 1, 2} -> F, hashes arbitrary-length bit strings
    to elements of a finite field; its implementation is defined in
    {{hashtobase}}.

-   The function map\_to\_curve, F -> E, calculates a point on the elliptic curve E
    from an element of the finite field F over which E is defined.
    {{mappings}} describes mappings for a range of curve families.

-   The function clear\_cofactor, E -> G, sends any point on the curve E to
    the subgroup G of E. {{cofactor-clearing}} describes methods to perform
    this operation.

We describe two high-level encoding functions ({{term-encoding}}).
Although these functions have the same interface, the
distributions of their outputs are different.

-   Nonuniform encoding (encode\_to\_curve). This function encodes bit strings to points in G.
    The distribution of the output is not uniformly random in G.

~~~
encode_to_curve(alpha)

Input: alpha, an arbitrary-length bit string.
Output: P, a point in G.

Steps:

~~~

-   Random oracle encoding (hash\_to\_curve). This function encodes bit strings to points in G.
    This function is suitable for applications requiring a random oracle returning points in G,
    provided that map\_to\_curve is "well distributed" ({{FFSTV13}}, Def. 1).
    All of the map\_to\_curve functions defined in {{mappings}} meet this requirement.

~~~
hash_to_curve(alpha)

Input: alpha, an arbitrary-length bit string.
Output: P, a point in G.

Steps:
1. u0 = hash_to_base(alpha, 0)
2. u1 = hash_to_base(alpha, 1)
3. Q0 = map_to_curve(u0)
4. Q1 = map_to_curve(u1)
5. R = Q0 + Q1 // Point addition
6. P = clear_cofactor(R)
7. return P

Instances of these functions are given in {{suites}}, which defines a list of
suites that specify a full set of parameters matching elliptic curves and
algorithms.

## Domain separation requirements {#domain-separation}

When invoking hash\_to\_curve or encode\_to\_curve from a higher-level protocol,
implementors MUST always use domain separation ({{term-domain-separation}}) to
avoid interfering with other protocols that also use the same functionality.

Protocols that instantiate multiple, independent hash functions based on
either hash\_to\_curve or encode\_to\_curve MUST enforce domain separation
between those hash functions.
This requirement applies both in the case of multiple hashes to the same
curve and in the case of multiple hashes to different curves.
(This is because the hash\_to\_base primitive ({{hashtobase}}) requires
domain separation to guarantee independent outputs.)

Care is required when choosing a domain separation tag.
Implementors MUST observe the following guidelines:

1. Tags must be supplied as the DST parameter to hash\_to\_base, as
   described in {{hashtobase}}.

2. Tags must begin with a fixed protocol identification string.
   This identification string should be unique to the protocol.

3. Tags must include a protocol version number.

4. For protocols that define multiple ciphersuites, each ciphersuite's
   tag must be different. For this purpose, it is recommended to
   include a ciphersuite identifier in each tag.

5. For protocols that use multiple encodings, either to the same curve
   or to different curves, each encoding must use a different tag.

As an example, consider a fictional key exchange protocol named Quux
that defines several different ciphersuites.
A reasonable choice of tag is "QUUX-V\<xx\>-CS\<yy\>", where \<xx\> and \<yy\>
are two-digit numbers indicating the version and ciphersuite, respectively.

As another example, consider a fictional protocol named Baz that requires
two independent random oracles, where one oracle outputs points on the curve
E1 and the other outputs points on the curve E2.
Reasonable choices of tags for the E1 and E2 oracles are
"BAZ-V\<xx\>-CS\<yy\>-E1" and "BAZ-V\<xx\>-CS\<yy\>-E2", respectively,
where \<xx\> and \<yy\> are as described above.

# Utility Functions {#utility}

Algorithms in this document make use of utility functions described below.

For security reasons, all field operations, comparisons, and assignments
MUST be implemented in constant time (i.e., execution time MUST NOT depend
on the values of the inputs), and without branching.
Guidance on implementing these low-level operations in constant time is
beyond the scope of this document.

-   CMOV(a, b, c): If c is False, CMOV returns a, otherwise it returns b.
    To prevent against timing attacks, this operation must run in constant
    time, without revealing the value of c.
    Commonly, implementations assume that the selector c is 1 for True or
    0 for False. In this case, given a bit string C, the desired selector c can
    be computed by OR-ing all bits of C together. The resulting selector will be
    either 0 if all bits of C are zero, or 1 if at least one bit of C is 1.

-   is\_square(x): This function returns True whenever the value x is a
    square in the field F. Due to Euler's criterion, this function can be
    calculated in constant time as

~~~
is_square(x) := { True,  if x^((q - 1) / 2) is 0 or 1 in F;
                { False, otherwise.
~~~

-   sqrt(x): The sqrt operation is a multi-valued function, i.e. there exist
    two roots of x in the field F whenever x is square.
    To maintain compatibility across implementations while allowing implementors
    leeway for optimizations, this document does not require sqrt() to return a
    particular value. Instead, as explained in {{point-sign}}, any higher-level
    function that computes square roots also specifies how to determine the sign
    of the result.

    The preferred way of computing square roots is to fix a deterministic
    algorithm particular to F. We give algorithms for the three most common
    cases immediately below; other cases are analogous.

    Note that Case 3 below applies to GF(p^2) when p = 3 (mod 8).
    {{AR13}} and {{S85}} describe methods that work for other field extensions.
    Regardless of the method chosen, the sqrt function MUST be performed in
    constant time.

~~~
s = sqrt(x)

Parameters:
- F, a finite field of characteristic p and order q = p^m, m >= 1.

Input: x, an element of F.
Output: s, an element of F such that (s^2) == x.

======

Case 1: q = 3 (mod 4)

Constants:
1. c1 = (q + 1) / 4     // Integer arithmetic

Procedure:
1. return x^c1

======

Case 2: q = 5 (mod 8)

Constants:
1. c1 = sqrt(-1) in F, i.e., (c1^2) == -1 in F
2. c2 = (q + 3) / 8     // Integer arithmetic

Procedure:
1. t1 = x^c2
2.  e = (t1^2) == x
3.  s = CMOV(t1 * c1, t1, e)
3. return s

======

Case 3: q = 9 (mod 16)

Constants:
1. c1 = sqrt(-1) in F, i.e., (c1^2) == -1 in F
2. c2 = sqrt(c1) in F, i.e., (c2^2) == c1 in F
3. c3 = sqrt(-c1) in F, i.e., (c3^2) == -c1 in F
4. c4 = (q + 7) / 16    // Integer arithmetic

Procedure:
1.  t1 = x^c4
2.  t2 = c1 * t1
3.  t3 = c2 * t1
4.  t4 = c3 * t1
5.  e1 = (t2^2) == x
6.  e2 = (t3^2) == x
7.  t1 = CMOV(t1, t2, e1)  // Select t2 if (t2^2) == x
8.  t2 = CMOV(t4, t3, e2)  // Select t3 if (t3^2) == x
9.  e3 = (t2^2) == x
10.  s = CMOV(t1, t2, e3)  // Select the sqrt from t1 and t2
11. return s
~~~

-   sgn0(x): This function returns either +1 or -1 indicating the "sign" of x,
    where sgn0(x) == -1 just when x is lexically greater than -x.
    Thus, this function considers 0 to be positive.
    The following procedure implements sgn0(x) in constant time.
    See {{bg-curves}} for a discussion of representing x as a vector.

~~~
sgn0(x)

Parameters:
- F, a finite field of characteristic p and order q = p^m, m >= 1.

Input: x, an element of F.
Output: -1 or 1 (an integer).

Notation: x_i is the i^th element of the vector representation of x.

Steps:
1. sign = 0
2. for i in (m, m - 1, ..., 1):
3.   sign_i = CMOV(1, -1, x_i > ((p - 1) / 2))
4.   sign_i = CMOV(sign_i, 0, x_i == 0)
5.   sign = CMOV(sign, sign_i, sign == 0)
6. return CMOV(sign, 1, sign == 0)    // Regard x == 0 as positive
~~~

-   abs(x): The absolute value of x is defined in terms of sgn0
    in the natural way, namely, abs(x) := sgn0(x) * x.

-   inv0(x): This function returns the multiplicative inverse of x in F,
    extended to all of F by fixing inv0(0) == 0.
    To implement inv0 in constant time, compute inv0(x) := x^(q - 2).
    Notice on input 0, the output is 0 as required.

-   I2OSP and OS2IP: These functions are used to convert an octet string to
    and from a non-negative integer as described in {{RFC8017}}.

-   a \|\| b: denotes the concatenation of bit strings a and b.

# Hashing to a Finite Field {#hashtobase}

The hash\_to\_base function hashes a string msg of any length into an element of a
field F. This function is parametrized by the field F ({{bg-curves}}) and by H,
a cryptographic hash function that outputs b bits.

## Security considerations {#hashtobase-sec}

For security, hash\_to\_base should be collision resistant and its output distribution
should be uniform over F. To this end, hash\_to\_base requires
a cryptographic hash function H which satisfies the following properties:

1. The number of bits output by H should be b >= 2 * k for sufficient collision
resistance, where k is the target security level in bits. (This is needed for a
birthday bound of approximately 2^(-k).)
2. H is modeled as a random oracle, so care should be taken when instantiating it.
Hash functions in the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families are typical and RECOMMENDED choices.

For example, for 128-bit security, b >= 256 bits; in this case, SHA256 would
be an appropriate choice for H.

Ensuring that the hash\_to\_base output is a uniform random element of F requires
care, even when H is modeled as a random oracle. For example,
if H is SHA256 and F is a field of characteristic p = 2^255 - 19, then the
result of reducing H(msg) (a 256-bit integer) modulo p is slightly more likely
to be in \[0, 37\] than if the value were selected uniformly at random.
In this example the bias is negligible, but in general it can be significant.

To control bias, the input msg should be hashed to an integer comprising at
least ceil(log2(p)) + k bits; reducing this integer modulo p gives bias at
most 2^-k, which is a safe choice for a cryptosystem with k-bit security.
To obtain such an integer, HKDF {{!RFC5869}} is used to expand the input
msg to a L-byte string, where L = ceil((ceil(log2(p)) + k) / 8); this
string is then interpreted as an integer via OS2IP {{RFC8017}}. For example,
for p a 255-bit prime and k = 128-bit security, L = ceil((255 + 128) / 8) = 48 bytes.

Finally, hash\_to\_base appends one zero byte to msg in the invocation of HKDF-Extract.
This ensures that the use of HKDF in hash\_to\_base is indifferentiable
from a random oracle (see {{LBB19}}, Lemma 8 and {{DRST12}}, Theorems 4.3 and 4.4).
(In particular, this approach works because it ensures that the final byte of
each HMAC invocation in HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand is distinct.)

{{domain-separation}} discusses requirements for domain separation and
recommendations for choosing domain separation tags. The hash\_to\_curve
function takes such a tag as a parameter, DST; this is the REQUIRED
method for applying domain separation.

{{hashtobase-impl}} details the hash\_to\_base procedure.

Note that implementors SHOULD NOT use rejection sampling to generate a uniformly
random element of F.
The reason is that these procedures are difficult to implement in constant time,
and later well-meaning "optimizations" may silently render an implementation
non-constant-time.

## Performance considerations {#hashtobase-perf}

The hash\_to\_base function uses HKDF-Extract to combine the
input msg and domain separation tag DST into a short digest, which is then
passed to HKDF-Expand {{!RFC5869}}.
For short messages, this entails at most two extra invocations of H, which
is a negligible overhead in the context of hashing to elliptic curves.

A related issue is that the random oracle construction described in {{roadmap}}
requires evaluating two independent hash functions H0 and H1 on msg.
One way to instantiate independent hashes is to append a counter to
the value being hashed, e.g., H(msg || 0) and H(msg || 1).
If msg is long, however, this is either inefficient (because it entails hashing
msg twice) or requires non-black-box use of H (e.g., partial evaluation).

To sidestep both of these issues, hash\_to\_base takes a second argument, ctr,
which it passes to HKDF-Expand.
This means that two invocations of hash\_to\_base on the same msg with different
ctr values both start with identical invocations of HKDF-Extract.
This is an improvement because it allows sharing one evaluation of HKDF-Extract
among multiple invocations of hash\_to\_base, i.e., by factoring out the common
computation.

## Implementation {#hashtobase-impl}

The following procedure implements hash\_to\_base.

~~~
hash_to_base(msg, ctr)

Parameters:
- DST, a domain separation tag (see discussion above).
- H, a cryptographic hash function.
- F, a finite field of characteristic p and order q = p^m.
- p, the characteristic of F (see immediately above).
- m, the extension degree of F (see immediately above).
- L = ceil((ceil(log2(p)) + k) / 8), where k is the security
  parameter of the cryptosystem (e.g., k = 128).
- HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand are as defined in RFC5869,
  instantiated with the hash function H.

Inputs:
- msg is the message to hash.
- ctr is 0, 1, or 2.
  This is used to efficiently create independent
  instances of hash_to_base (see discussion above).

Output:
- u, an element in F.

Steps:
1. msg_prime = HKDF-Extract(DST, msg || I2OSP(0, 1))
2. info_pfx = "H2C" || I2OSP(ctr, 1)   // "H2C" is a 3-byte ASCII string
3. for i in (1, ..., m):
4.   info = info_pfx || I2OSP(i, 1)
5.   t = HKDF-Expand(msg_prime, info, L)
6.   e_i = OS2IP(t) (mod p)
7. u = (e_1, ..., e_m)
8. return u

# Deterministic Mappings  {#mappings}

The mappings in this section are suitable for constructing either nonuniform
or random oracle encodings using the constructions of {{roadmap}}.

## Interface

The generic interface shared by all mappings in this section is as follows:

~~~
(x, y) = map_to_curve(u)
~~~

The input u and outputs x and y are elements of the field F.
The coordinates (x, y) specify a point on an elliptic curve defined over F.
Note that the point (x, y) is not a uniformly random point. If uniformity
is required for security, the random oracle construction of {{roadmap}} MUST be
used instead.

## Notation

As a rough style guide the following convention is used:

- All arithmetic operations are performed over a field F, unless
  explicitly stated otherwise.

- u: the input to the mapping function.
  This is an element of F produced by the hash\_to\_base function.

- (x, y): are the affine coordinates of the point output by the mapping.
  Indexed values are used when the algorithm calculates some candidate values.

- t1, t2, ...: are reusable temporary variables. For notable variables,
    distinct names are used easing the debugging process when correlating with
    test vectors.

- c1, c2, ...: are constant values, which can be computed in advance.


## Sign of the resulting point {#point-sign}

In general, elliptic curves have equations of the form y^2 = g(x).
Most of the mappings in this section first identify an x such that
g(x) is square, then take a square root to find y. Since there
are two square roots when g(x) != 0, this results in an ambiguity
regarding the sign of y.

To resolve this ambiguity, the mappings in this section specify
the sign of the y-coordinate in terms of the input to the mapping function.
Two main reasons support this approach. First, this covers elliptic curves over
any field in a uniform way, and second, it gives implementors leeway to optimize
their square-root implementations.

## Exceptional cases {#map-exceptions}

Mappings may have have exceptional cases, i.e., inputs u
on which the mapping is undefined. These cases must be handled
carefully, especially for constant-time implementations.

For each mapping in this section, we discuss the exceptional cases and show
how to handle them in constant time. Note that all implementations SHOULD use
inv0 ({{utility}}) to compute multiplicative inverses, to avoid exceptional
cases that result from attempting to compute the inverse of 0.

## Mappings for Weierstrass curves

The following mappings apply to elliptic curves defined by the equation
E: y^2 = g(x) = x^3 + A * x + B, where 4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 != 0.

### Shallue-van de Woestijne Method {#svdw}

Shallue and van de Woestijne {{SW06}} describe a mapping that applies to
essentially any elliptic curve.
This generality, however, comes at a price: this mapping is strictly
more expensive to evaluate than the other mappings in this document.

The parameterization given below works for essentially any Weierstrass curve;
its derivation is detailed in {{W19}}.
Fouque and Tibouchi {{FT12}} give a different parameterization of this mapping
that works for Barreto-Naehrig pairing-friendly curves {{BN05}}, i.e.,
curves y^2 = x^3 + B over fields of characteristic q = 1 (mod 3).
Wahby and Boneh {{WB19}} suggest a small modification to the Fouque-Tibouchi
parameters that results in a uniform method for handling exceptional cases;
that method is the one used below.

Preconditions: A Weierstrass curve y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B over F = GF(p^m)
where p > 5 and odd.

Constants:

- A and B, the parameter of the Weierstrass curve.

- Z, an element of F meeting the below criteria.
  {{svdw-z-code}} gives a Sage {{SAGE}} script that outputs the RECOMMENDED Z.
  1. g(Z) != 0 in F.
  2. -(3 * Z^2 + 4 * A) / (4 * g(Z)) != 0 in F.
  3. -(3 * Z^2 + 4 * A) / (4 * g(Z)) is square in F.
  4. At least one of g(Z) and g(-Z / 2) is square in F.

Sign of y: Inputs u and -u give the same x-coordinate.
Thus, we set sgn0(y) == sgn0(u).

Exceptions: The exceptional cases for u occur when
(1 + u^2 * g(Z)) * (1 - u^2 * g(Z)) == 0.
The restrictions on Z given above ensure that implementations that use inv0
to invert this product are exception free.

Operations:

~~~
1. t1 = u^2 * g(Z)
2. t2 = 1 + t1
3. t1 = 1 - t1
4. t3 = inv0(t1 * t2)
5. t4 = u * t1 * t3 * sqrt(-g(Z) * (3 * Z^2 + 4 * A))
6. x1 = -Z / 2 - t4
7. x2 = -Z / 2 + t4
8. t5 = 2 * t2^2 * t3 * sqrt(-g(Z) / (3 * Z^2 + 4 * A))
9. x3 = Z + t5^2
10. If is_square(g(x1)), set x = x1 and y = sqrt(g(x1))
11. Else If is_square(g(x2)), set x = x2 and y = sqrt(g(x2))
12. Else set x = x3 and y = sqrt(g(x3))
13. If sgn0(u) != sgn0(y), set y = -y
14. return (x, y)
~~~

#### Implementation

The following procedure implements the Shallue and van de Woestijne method in a
straight-line fashion.

~~~
map_to_curve_svdw(u)
Input: u, an element of F.
Output: (x, y), a point on E.

Constants:
1. c1 = g(Z)
2. c2 = -Z / 2
3. c3 = sqrt(-g(Z) * (3 * Z^2 + 4 * A))         // sgn0(c3) MUST equal 1
4. c4 = -4 * g(Z) / (3 * Z^2 + 4 * A)

Steps:
1.   t1 = u^2
2.   t1 = t1 * c1
3.   t2 = 1 + t1
4.   t1 = 1 - t1
5.   t3 = t1 * t2
6.   t3 = inv0(t3)
7.   t4 = u * t1
8.   t4 = t4 * t3
9.   t4 = t4 * c3
10.  x1 = c2 - t4
11. gx1 = x1^2
12. gx1 = gx1 + A
13. gx1 = gx1 * x1
14. gx1 = gx1 + B
15.  e1 = is_square(gx1)
16.  x2 = c2 + t4
17. gx2 = x2^2
18. gx2 = gx2 + A
19. gx2 = gx2 * x2
20. gx2 = gx2 + B
21.  e2 = is_square(gx2) AND NOT e1     // Avoid short-circuit logic ops
22.  x3 = t2^2
23.  x3 = x3 * t3
24.  x3 = x3^2
25.  x3 = x3 * c4
26.  x3 = x3 + Z
27.   x = CMOV(x3, x1, e1)      // x = x1 if gx1 is square, else x = x3
28.   x = CMOV(x, x2, e2)       // x = x2 if gx2 is square and gx1 is not
29.  gx = x^2
30.  gx = gx + A
31.  gx = gx * x
32.  gx = gx + B
33.   y = sqrt(gx)
34.  e3 = sgn0(u) == sgn0(y)
35.   y = CMOV(-y, y, e3)       // Select correct sign of y
36. return (x, y)
~~~

### Simplified Shallue-van de Woestijne-Ulas Method {#simple-swu}

The function map\_to\_curve\_simple\_swu(u) implements a simplification
of the Shallue-van de Woestijne-Ulas mapping {{U07}} described by Brier et
al. {{BCIMRT10}}, which they call the "simplified SWU" map. Wahby and Boneh
{{WB19}} generalize this mapping to curves over fields of odd characteristic p > 3.

Preconditions: A Weierstrass curve y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B over F = GF(p^m)
where p > 5 and odd, A != 0, and B != 0.

Constants:

- A and B, the parameters of the Weierstrass curve.

- Z, an element of F meeting the below criteria.
  {{sswu-z-code}} gives a Sage {{SAGE}} script that outputs the RECOMMENDED Z.
  The criteria are:
  1. Z is non-square in F,
  2. Z != -1 in F,
  3. the polynomial g(x) - Z is irreducible over F, and
  4. g(B / (Z * A)) is square in F.

Sign of y: Inputs u and -u give the same x-coordinate.
Thus, we set sgn0(y) == sgn0(u).

Exceptions: The exceptional cases are values of u such that
Z^2 * u^4 + Z * u^2 == 0. This includes u == 0, and may include
other values depending on Z. Implementations must detect
this case and set x1 = B / (Z * A), which guarantees that g(x1)
is square by the condition on Z given above.

Operations:

~~~
1.  t1 = inv0(Z^2 * u^4 + Z * u^2)
2.  x1 = (-B / A) * (1 + t1)
3.  If t1 == 0, set x1 = B / (Z * A)
4. gx1 = x1^3 + A * x1 + B
5.  x2 = Z * u^2 * x1
6. gx2 = x2^3 + A * x2 + B
7.  If is_square(gx1), set x = x1 and y = sqrt(gx1)
8.  Else set x = x2 and y = sqrt(gx2)
9.  If sgn0(u) != sgn0(y), set y = -y
10. return (x, y)
~~~

#### Implementation

The following procedure implements the simplified SWU mapping in a straight-line fashion.
{{samplecode}} gives an optimized straight-line procedure for P-256 {{FIPS186-4}}.
For more information on optimizing this mapping, see
{{WB19}} Section 4 or the example code found at {{hash2curve-repo}}.

~~~
map_to_curve_simple_swu(u)
Input: u, an element of F.
Output: (x, y), a point on E.

Constants:
1.  c1 = -B / A
2.  c2 = -1 / Z

Steps:
1.   t1 = Z * u^2
2.   t2 = t1^2
3.   x1 = t1 + t2
4.   x1 = inv0(x1)
5.   e1 = x1 == 0
6.   x1 = x1 + 1
7.   x1 = CMOV(x1, c2, e1)    // If (t1 + t2) == 0, set x1 = -1 / Z
8.   x1 = x1 * c1      // x1 = (-B / A) * (1 + (1 / (Z^2 * u^4 + Z * u^2)))
9.  gx1 = x1^2
10. gx1 = gx1 + A
11. gx1 = gx1 * x1
12. gx1 = gx1 + B             // gx1 = g(x1) = x1^3 + A * x1 + B
13.  x2 = t1 * x1             // x2 = Z * u^2 * x1
14.  t2 = t1 * t2
15. gx2 = gx1 * t2            // gx2 = (Z * u^2)^3 * gx1
16.  e2 = is_square(gx1)
17.   x = CMOV(x2, x1, e2)    // If is_square(gx1), x = x1, else x = x2
18.  y2 = CMOV(gx2, gx1, e2)  // If is_square(gx1), y2 = gx1, else y2 = gx2
19.   y = sqrt(y2)
20.  e3 = sgn0(u) == sgn0(y)  // Fix sign of y
21.   y = CMOV(-y, y, e3)
22. return (x, y)

## Mappings for Montgomery curves {#montgomery}

The mapping defined in {{elligator2}} implements Elligator 2 {{BHKL13}} for
curves defined by the Weierstrass equation y^2 = x^3 + A * x^2 + B * x,
where A * B * (A^2 - 4 * B) != 0 and A^2 - 4 * B is non-square in F.

Such a Weierstrass curve is related to the Montgomery curve
B' * y'^2 = x'^3 + A' * x'^2 + x' by the following change of variables:

- A = A' / B'
- B = 1 / B'^2
- x = x' / B'
- y = y' / B'

The Elligator 2 mapping given below returns a point (x, y) on the
Weierstrass curve defined above.
This point can be converted to a point (x', y') on the original
Montgomery curve by computing

- x' = B' * x
- y' = B' * y

Note that when B and B' are equal to 1, the above two curve equations
are identical and no conversion is necessary.
This is the case, for example, for Curve25519 and Curve448 {{RFC7748}}.

### Elligator 2 Method {#elligator2}

Preconditions: A Weierstrass curve y^2 = x^3 + A * x^2 + B * x
where A != 0, B != 0, and A^2 - 4 * B is non-zero and non-square in F.

Constants:

- A and B, the parameters of the elliptic curve.

- Z, a non-square element of F.
  {{elligator-z-code}} gives a Sage {{SAGE}} script that outputs the RECOMMENDED Z.

Sign of y: Inputs u and -u give the same x-coordinate.
Thus, we set sgn0(y) == sgn0(u).

Exceptions: The exceptional case is Z * u^2 == -1, i.e., 1 + Z * u^2 == 0.
Implementations must detect this case and set x1 = -A.
Note that this can only happen when q = 3 (mod 4).

Operations:

~~~
1.  x1 = -A * inv0(1 + Z * u^2)
2.  If x1 == 0, set x1 = -A.
3. gx1 = x1^3 + A * x1^2 + B * x1
4.  x2 = -x1 - A
5. gx2 = x2^3 + A * x2^2 + B * x2
6.  If is_square(gx1), set x = x1 and y = sqrt(gx1)
7.  Else if is_square(gx2), set x = x2 and y = sqrt(gx2)
8.  If sgn0(u) != sgn0(y), set y = -y
9.  return (x, y)
~~~

#### Implementation

The following procedure implements Elligator 2 in a straight-line fashion.
{{samplecode}} gives optimized straight-line procedures for curve25519 and
curve448 {{RFC7748}}.

~~~
map_to_curve_elligator2(u)
Input: u, an element of F.
Output: (x, y), a point on E.

Steps:
1.   t1 = u^2
2.   t1 = Z * t1              // Z * u^2
3.   x1 = t1 + 1
4.   x1 = inv0(x1)
5.   e1 = x1 == 0
6.   x1 = CMOV(x1, 1, e1)     // if x1 == 0, set x1 = 1
7.   x1 = -A * x1             // x1 = -A / (1 + Z * u^2)
8.  gx1 = x1 + A
9.  gx1 = gx1 * x1
10. gx1 = gx1 + B
11. gx1 = gx1 * x1            // gx1 = x1^3 + A * x1^2 + B * x1
12.  x2 = -x1 - A
13. gx2 = t1 * gx1
14.  e2 = is_square(gx1)
15.   x = CMOV(x2, x1, e2)    // If is_square(gx1), x = x1, else x = x2
16.  y2 = CMOV(gx2, gx1, e2)  // If is_square(gx1), y2 = gx1, else y2 = gx2
17.   y = sqrt(y2)
18.  e3 = sgn0(u) == sgn0(y)  // Fix sign of y
19.   y = CMOV(-y, y, e3)
20. return (x, y)

## Mappings for Twisted Edwards curves

Twisted Edwards curves (a class of curves that includes Edwards curves)
are closely related to Montgomery
curves ({{montgomery}}): every twisted Edwards curve is birationally equivalent
to a Montgomery curve ({{BBJLP08}}, Theorem 3.2).
This equivalence yields an efficient way of hashing to a twisted Edwards curve:
first, hash to the equivalent Montgomery curve, then transform the
result into a point on the twisted Edwards curve via a rational map.
This method of hashing to a twisted Edwards curve thus requires identifying a
corresponding Montgomery curve and rational map.
We describe how to identify such a curve and map immediately below.

### Rational maps from Montgomery to twisted Edwards curves {#rational-map}

There are two ways to identify the correct Montgomery curve and
rational map for use when hashing to a given twisted Edwards curve.

When hashing to a standardized twisted Edwards curve for which a corresponding
Montgomery form and rational map are also standardized, the standard
Montgomery form and rational map MUST be used to ensure compatibility
with existing software.
Two such standardized curves are the edwards25519 and edwards448 curves,
which correspond to the Montgomery curves curve25519 and curve448, respectively.
For both of these curves, {{RFC7748}} lists both the Montgomery and twisted Edwards
forms and gives the corresponding rational maps.

The rational map for edwards25519 ({{RFC7748}}, Section 4.1)
uses the constant sqrt\_neg\_486664 = sqrt(-486664) (mod 2^255 - 19).
To ensure compatibility, this constant MUST be chosen such that
sgn0(sqrt\_neg\_486664) == 1.
Analogous ambiguities in other standardized rational maps MUST be
resolved in the same way: for any constant k whose sign is ambiguous,
k MUST be chosen such that sgn0(k) == 1.

The 4-isogeny map from curve448 to edwards448 ({{RFC7748}}, Section 4.2)
is unambiguous with respect to sign.

When defining new twisted Edwards curves, a Montgomery equivalent and rational
map SHOULD be specified, and the sign of the rational map SHOULD be stated
unambiguously.

When hashing to a twisted Edwards curve that does not have a standardized
Montgomery form or rational map, the following procedure MUST be
used to derive them.
For a twisted Edwards curve given by a * x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d * x^2 * y^2,
first compute A and B, the parameters of the equivalent curve given by
y'^2 = x'^3 + A * x'^2 + B * x', as follows:

- A = (a + d) / 2
- B = (a - d)^2 / 16

Note that the above curve is given in the Weierstrass form required
by the Elligator 2 mapping of {{elligator2}}.
The rational map from the point (x', y') on this Weierstrass curve
to the point (x, y) on the twisted Edwards curve is given by

- x = x' / y'
- y = (B' * x' - 1) / (B' * x' + 1), where B' = 1 / sqrt(B) = 4 / (a - d)

For completeness, we give the inverse map in {{rational-map-inverse}}.
Note that the inverse map is not used when hashing to a twisted Edwards curve.

Rational maps may be undefined, for example, when the denominator of one
of the rational functions is zero.
For example, in the map described above, the exceptional cases are
y' == 0 or B' * x' == -1.
Implementations MUST detect exceptional cases and return the value
(x, y) = (0, 1), which is a valid point on all twisted Edwards curves
given by the equation above.

The following straight-line implementation of the above rational map
handles the exceptional cases.
Implementations of other rational maps (e.g., the ones give in {{RFC7748}})
are analogous.

~~~
rational_map(x', y')
Input: (x', y'), a point on the curve y'^2 = x'^3 + A * x'^2 + B * x'.
Output: (x, y), a point on the equivalent twisted Edwards curve.

1. t1 = y' * B'
2. t2 = x' + 1
3. t3 = t1 * t2
4. t3 = inv0(t3)
5.  x = t2 * t3
6.  x = x * x'
7.  y = x' - 1
8.  y = y * t3
9.  y = y * t1
10. e = y == 0
11. y = CMOV(y, 1, e)
12. return (x, y)
~~~

3. return (x, y)
~~~

4.  y = u
5. return (x, y)
~~~

### Elligator 2, A == 0 Method {#ell2a0}

The function map\_to\_curve\_ell2A0(u) implements an adaptation of Elligator 2
{{BLMP19}} targeting curves given by y^2 = x^3 + B * x over F such that q = 3 (mod 4).

Preconditions: An elliptic curve over F such that q = 3 (mod 4).

## Mappings for Pairing-Friendly curves

### Simplified SWU for Pairing-Friendly Curves {#simple-swu-pairing-friendly}

Wahby and Boneh {{WB19}} show how to adapt the simplified SWU mapping to
certain Weierstrass curves having either A = 0 or B = 0, one of which is
almost always true for pairing-friendly curves. Note that neither case is
supported by the mapping of {{simple-swu}}.

This method requires finding another elliptic curve

~~~
E': y^2 = g'(x) = x^3 + A' * x + B'
~~~

that is isogenous to E and has A' != 0 and B' != 0.
(One might do this, for example, using {{SAGE}}; details are beyond the scope of this document.)
This isogeny defines a map iso\_map(x', y') that takes as input a point
on E' and produces as output a point on E.

Once E' and iso\_map are identified, this mapping works as follows: on input
u, first apply the simplified SWU mapping to get a point on E', then apply
the isogeny map to that point to get a point on E.

Note that iso\_map is a group homomorphism, meaning that point addition
commutes with iso\_map.
Thus, when using this mapping in the hash\_to\_curve construction of {{roadmap}},
one can effect a small optimization by first mapping u0 and u1 to E', adding
the resulting points on E', and then applying iso\_map to the sum.
This gives the same result while requiring only one evaluation of iso\_map.

Preconditions: An elliptic curve E' with A' != 0 and B' != 0 that is
isogenous to the target curve E with isogeny map iso\_map(x, y) from
E' to E.

Helper functions:

- map\_to\_curve\_simple\_swu is the mapping of {{simple-swu}} to E'
- iso\_map is the isogeny map from E' to E

Sign of y: for this map, the sign is determined by map\_to\_curve_elligator2.
No further sign adjustments are necessary.

Exceptions: map\_to\_curve\_simple\_swu handles its exceptional cases.
Exceptional cases of iso\_map should return the identity point on E.

Operations:

~~~
1. (x', y') = map_to_curve_simple_swu(u)    // (x', y') is on E'
2.   (x, y) = iso_map(x', y')               // (x, y) is on E
3. return (x, y)
~~~

We do not repeat the sample implementation of {{simple-swu}} here.
See {{hash2curve-repo}} or {{WB19}} for details on implementing the isogeny map.

# Clearing the cofactor {#cofactor-clearing}

The mappings of {{mappings}} always output a point on the elliptic curve,
i.e., a point in a group of order h * r ({{bg-curves}}). Obtaining a point in G
may require a final operation commonly called "clearing the cofactor," which
takes as input any point on the curve.

The cofactor can always be cleared via scalar multiplication by h.
For elliptic curves where h = 1, i.e., the curves with a prime number of points,
no operation is required. This applies, for example, to the NIST curves P-256,
P-384, and P-521 {{FIPS186-4}}.

In some cases, it is possible to clear the cofactor via a faster method than
scalar multiplication by h.
These methods are equivalent to (but usually faster than) multiplication by
some scalar h\_eff whose value is determined by the method and the curve.
Examples of fast cofactor clearing methods include the following:

- For certain pairing-friendly curves having subgroup G2 over an extension
  field, Scott et al. {{SBCDK09}} describe a method for fast cofactor clearing
  that exploits an efficiently-computable endomorphism. Fuentes-Castaneda
  et al. {{FKR11}} propose an alternative method that is sometimes more efficient.
  Budroni and Pintore {{BP18}} give concrete instantiations of these methods
  for Barreto-Lynn-Scott pairing-friendly curves {{BLS03}}.

- Wahby and Boneh ({{WB19}}, Section 5) describe a trick due to Scott for
  fast cofactor clearing on any elliptic curve for which the prime
  factorization of h and the structure of the elliptic curve group meet
  certain conditions.

The clear\_cofactor function is parameterized by a scalar h\_eff.
Specifically,

~~~
clear_cofactor(P) := h_eff * P
~~~

where \* represents scalar multiplication.
When a curve does not support a fast cofactor clearing method, h\_eff = h
and the cofactor MUST be cleared via scalar multiplication.

When a curve admits a fast cofactor clearing method, clear\_cofactor
MAY be evaluated either via that method or via scalar multiplication
by the equivalent h\_eff; these two methods give the same result.
Note that in this case scalar multiplication by the cofactor h does not
generally give the same result as the fast method, and SHOULD NOT be used.

# Suites for Hashing {#suites}

This section lists recommended suites for hashing to standard elliptic curves.

A suite fully specifies the procedure for hashing bit strings to
points on a specific elliptic curve group.
Each suite comprises the following parameters:

- Suite ID, a short name used to refer to a given suite.
  The ID also indicates whether a suite is a random oracle or nonuniform
  encoding ({{term-rom}}, {{roadmap}}).
  {{suiteIDformat}} discusses the naming conventions for suite IDs.
- E, the target elliptic curve over a field F.
- p, the characteristic of the field F.
- m, the extension degree of the field F.
- H, the hash function used by hash\_to\_base ({{hashtobase-sec}}).
- L, the length of HKDF-Expand output in hash\_to\_base ({{hashtobase-sec}}).
- f, a mapping function from {{mappings}}.
- h\_eff, the scalar parameter for clear\_cofactor ({{cofactor-clearing}}).

In addition to the above parameters, the mapping f may require
additional parameters Z, M, rational\_map, E', and/or iso\_map.
These MUST be specified when applicable.

All applications MUST choose a domain separation tag (DST)
for use with hash\_to\_base ({{hashtobase}}), in accordance with the
guidelines of {{domain-separation}}.
In addition, applications whose security requires a random oracle MUST use
a suite specifying hash\_to\_curve ({{roadmap}}); see {{suiteIDformat}}.

When standardizing a new elliptic curve, corresponding hash-to-curve
suites SHOULD be specified.

The below table lists the curves for which suites are defined and
the subsection that gives the corresponding parameters.

| E                         | Section              |

| BLS12-381                 | {{suites-bls12381}}  |

## Suite ID naming conventions {#suiteIDformat}

Suite IDs MUST be constructed as follows:

    CURVE_ID || "-" || HASH_ID || "-" || MAP_ID || "-" || ENC_VAR || "-"

The fields CURVE\_ID, HASH\_ID, MAP\_ID, and ENC\_VAR are
ASCII-encoded strings of at most 64 characters each.
Fields can contain only ASCII characters between 0x21 and 0x7E (inclusive)
other than hyphen and underscore (i.e., 0x2d, and 0x5f).
As indicated above, each field (including the last) is followed by a hyphen
("-", ASCII 0x2d); this helps to ensure that Suite IDs are prefix free.

Fields MUST be chosen as follows:

- CURVE\_ID: a human-readable representation of the target elliptic curve.

- HASH\_ID: a human-readable representation of the hash function used in
  hash\_to\_base ({{hashtobase}}).

- MAP\_ID: a human-readable representation of the map\_to\_curve function
  ({{mappings}}).

- ENC\_VAR: a string indicating the encoding type and other information.
  The first two characters of this string indicate whether the suite
  represents a hash\_to\_curve or an encode\_to\_curve operation
  ({{roadmap}}), as follows:

    - If ENC\_VAR begins with "RO", the suite uses hash\_to\_curve.
    - If ENC\_VAR begins with "NU", the suite uses encode\_to\_curve.
    - ENC\_VAR MUST NOT begin with any other string.

    ENC\_VAR MAY also be used to encode other information used to identify
    variants, for example, a version number.
    The RECOMMENDED way to do so is to add one or more subfields separated
    by colons.
    For example, "RO:V02" is an appropriate ENC\_VAR value for the second
    version of a random-oracle suite, while "RO:V02:FOO01:BAR17" might be
    used to indicate a variant of that suite.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Security Considerations

When constant-time implementations are required, all basic operations and
utility functions must be implemented in constant time, as discussed in
{{utility}}.

Each encoding function accepts arbitrary input and maps it to a pseudorandom
point on the curve.
Directly evaluating the mappings of {{mappings}} produces an output that is
distinguishable from random.
{{roadmap}} shows how to use these mappings to construct a function approximating a
random oracle.

{{domain-separation}} describes considerations related to domain separation
for random oracle encodings.

{{hashtobase}} describes considerations for uniformly hashing to field elements.

When the hash\_to\_curve function ({{roadmap}}) is instantiated
with hash\_to\_base ({{hashtobase}}), the resulting function is
indifferentiable from a random oracle.
In most cases such a function can be safely used in protocols whose security
analysis assumes a random oracle that outputs points on an elliptic curve.
As Ristenpart et al. discuss in {{RSS11}}, however, not all security proofs
that rely on random oracles continue to hold when those oracles are replaced
by indifferentiable functionalities.
This limitation should be considered when analyzing the security of protocols
relying on the hash\_to\_curve function.

When hashing passwords using any function described in this document, an adversary
who learns the output of the hash function (or potentially any intermediate value,
e.g., the output of hash\_to\_base) may be able to carry out a dictionary attack.
To mitigate such attacks, it is recommended to first execute a more costly key
derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2 {{!RFC2898}} or scrypt {{!RFC7914}}) on the password,
then hash the output of that function to the target elliptic curve.
For collision resistance, the hash underlying the key derivation function
should be chosen according to the guidelines listed in {{hashtobase-sec}}.

# Related Work {#related}

The problem of mapping arbitrary bit strings to elliptic curve points
has been the subject of both practical and theoretical research.
This section briefly describes the background and research results
that underly the recommendations in this document.
This section is provided for informational purposes only.

A naive but generally insecure method of mapping a string alpha to
a point on an elliptic curve E having n points is to first fix a point P that
generates the elliptic curve group, and a hash function Hn from bit strings
to integers less than n; then compute Hn(alpha) * P, where the * operator
represents scalar multiplication. The reason this approach is insecure is
that the resulting point has a known discrete log relationship to P.
Thus, except in cases where this method is specified by the protocol,
it must not be used; doing so risks catastrophic security failures.

Boneh et al. {{BLS01}} describe an encoding method they call MapToGroup,
which works roughly as follows: first, use the input string to initialize a
pseudorandom number generator, then use the generator to produce a pseudorandom
value x in F.
If x is the x-coordinate of a point on the elliptic curve, output that
point. Otherwise, generate a new pseudorandom value x in F and try again.
Since a random value x in F has probability about 1/2 of corresponding to
a point on the curve, the expected number of tries is just two.
However, the running time of this method depends on the input string,
which means that it is not safe to use in protocols sensitive to timing
side channels.

Schinzel and Skalba {{SS04}} introduce a method of constructing
elliptic curve points deterministically, for a restricted class of curves
and a very small number of points.
Skalba {{S05}} generalizes this construction to more curves and more points
on those curves.
Shallue and van de Woestijne {{SW06}} further generalize and simplify
Skalba's construction, yielding concretely efficient maps to a constant
fraction of the points on almost any curve.
Ulas {{U07}} describes a simpler version of this map, and Brier et
al. {{BCIMRT10}} give a further simplification, which the authors call the
"simplified SWU" map.
The simplified map applies only to fields of characteristic p = 3 (mod 4);
Wahby and Boneh {{WB19}} generalize to fields of any characteristic.

Boneh and Franklin give a deterministic algorithm mapping to certain
supersingular curves over fields of characteristic p = 2 (mod 3) {{BF01}}.
Icart gives another deterministic algorithm which maps to any curve
over a field of characteristic p = 2 (mod 3) {{Icart09}}.
Several extensions and generalizations follow this work, including
{{FSV09}}, {{FT10}}, {{KLR10}}, {{F11}}, and {{CK11}}.

Following the work of Farashahi {{F11}}, Fouque et al. {{FJT13}} describe a
mapping to curves of characteristic p = 3 (mod 4) having a number of points
divisible by 4.  Bernstein et al. {{BHKL13}} optimize this mapping and
describe a related mapping that they call "Elligator 2," which applies to
any curve over a field of odd characteristic having a point of order 2.
This includes Curve25519 and Curve448, both of which are CFRG-recommended
curves {{RFC7748}}.

An important caveat regarding all of the above deterministic mapping
functions is that none of them map to the entire curve, but rather to some
fraction of the points. This means that they cannot be used directly to
construct a random oracle that outputs points on the curve.

Brier et al. {{BCIMRT10}} give two solutions to this problem.
The first, which Brier et al. prove applies to Icart's method,
computes f(H0(msg)) + f(H1(msg)) for two distinct hash functions
H0 and H1 from bit strings to F and a mapping f from F to the elliptic curve E.
The second, which applies to essentially all deterministic mappings but
is more costly, computes f(H0(msg)) + H2(msg) * P, for P a generator of the
elliptic curve group and H2 a hash from bit strings to integers modulo r,
the order of the elliptic curve group.
Farashahi et al. {{FFSTV13}} improve the analysis of the first method,
showing that it applies to essentially all deterministic mappings.
Tibouchi and Kim {{TK17}} further refine the analysis and describe additional
optimizations.

Complementary to the problem of mapping from bit strings to elliptic curve
points, Bernstein et al. {{BHKL13}} study the problem of mapping from elliptic
curve points to uniformly random bit strings, giving solutions for a class of
curves including Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves.
Tibouchi {{T14}} and Aranha et al. {{AFQTZ14}} generalize these results.
This document does not deal with this complementary problem.

# Rational maps from twisted Edwards to Weierstrass and Montgomery curves {#rational-map-inverse}

The inverse of the rational map specified in {{rational-map}}, i.e.,
the map from the point (x', y') on the Weierstrass curve
y'^2 = x'^3 + A * x'^2 + B * x'
to the point (x, y) on the twisted Edwards curve
a * x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d * x^2 * y^2
is given by:

- x' = (1 + y) / (B' * (1 - y))
- y' = (1 + y) / (B' * x * (1 - y))

where

- A = (a + d) / 2
- B = (a - d)^2 / 16
- B' = 1 / sqrt(B) = 4 / (a - d)

This map is undefined when y == 1 or x == 0.
In this case, return the point (0, 0).

It may also be useful to map to a Montgomery curve
of the form B' * y''^2 = x''^3 + A' * x''^2 + x''.
This curve is equivalent to the twisted Edwards curve above via the
following rational map ({{BBJLP08}}, Theorem 3.2):

- A' = 2 * (a + d) / (a - d)
- B' = 4 / (a - d)
- x'' = (1 + y) / (1 - y)
- y'' = (1 + y) / (x * (1 - y))

# Isogeny maps for Suites {#appx-iso}

This section specifies the isogeny maps for the SECP256k1 and BLS12-381
suites listed in {{suites}}.

These maps are given in terms of affine coordinates.
Wahby and Boneh ({{WB19}}, Section 4.3) show how to evaluate these maps
in a projective coordinate system ({{projective-coords}}), which avoids
modular inversions.

Refer to the draft repository {{hash2curve-repo}} for a Sage {{SAGE}} script
that constructs these isogenies.

# Sample Code {#samplecode}

This section gives sample implementations optimized for some of the
elliptic curves listed in {{suites}}.
A future version of this document will include all listed curves, plus
accompanying test vectors.
Sample Sage {{SAGE}} code for each algorithm can also be found in the
draft repository {{hash2curve-repo}}.

## Interface and projective coordinate systems {#projective-coords}

The sample code in this section uses a different interface than
the mappings of {{mappings}}.
Specifically, each mapping function in this section has the following
signature:

~~~
(xn, xd, yn, nd) = map_to_curve(u)
~~~

The resulting point (x, y) is given by (xn / xd, yn / yd).

The reason for this modified interface is that it enables further
optimizations when working with points in a projective coordinate
system.
This is desirable, for example, when the resulting point will be
immediately multiplied by a scalar, since most scalar multiplication
algorithms operate on projective points.

The following are two commonly used projective coordinate systems
and the corresponding conversions:

- A point (X, Y, Z) in homogeneous projective coordinates corresponds
  to the affine point (x, y) = (X / Z, Y / Z);
  the inverse conversion is given by (X, Y, Z) = (x, y, 1).
  To convert (xn, xd, yn, yd) to homogeneous projective coordinates,
  compute (X, Y, Z) = (xn * yd, yn * xd, xd * yd).

- A point (X', Y', Z') in Jacobian projective coordinates corresponds
  to the affine point (x, y) = (X' / Z'^2, Y' / Z'^3);
  the inverse conversion is given by (X', Y', Z') = (x, y, 1).
  To convert (xn, xd, yn, yd) to Jacobian projective coordinates,
  compute (X', Y', Z') = (xn * xd * yd^2, yn * yd^2 * xd^3, xd * yd).
