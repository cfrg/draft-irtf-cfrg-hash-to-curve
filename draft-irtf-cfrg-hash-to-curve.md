--- abstract

This document specifies a number of algorithms that may be used to encode or hash an
arbitrary string to a point on an Elliptic Curve.

--- middle

# Introduction {#introduction}

Many cryptographic protocols require a procedure which maps arbitrary input, e.g.,
passwords, to points on an elliptic curve (EC). Prominent examples include
Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange {{Jablon96}}, Password Authenticated
Key Exchange {{BMP00}}, Identity-Based Encryption {{BF01}} and
Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures {{BLS01}}.

Unfortunately for implementors, the precise mapping which is suitable for a
given scheme is not necessarily included in the description of the protocol.
Compounding this problem is the need to pick a suitable curve for the specific
protocol.

This document aims to address this lapse by providing a thorough set of
recommendations across a range of implementations, and curve types. We provide
implementation and performance details for each mechanism, along with references
to the security rationale behind each recommendation and guidance for
applications not yet covered.

Each algorithm conforms to a common interface, i.e., it maps a bitstring
{0, 1}^\* to a point on an elliptic curve E. For each variant, we describe the requirements for
E to make it work. Sample code for each variant is presented in the
appendix.  Unless otherwise stated, all elliptic curve points are assumed to be
represented as affine coordinates, i.e., (x, y) points on a curve.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.


# Background {#background}

Here we give a brief definition of elliptic curves, with an emphasis
on defining important parameters and their relation to encoding.

Let F be the finite field GF(p^k). We say that F is a field of characteristic
p. For most applications, F is a prime field, in which case k=1 and we will
simply write GF(p).

Elliptic curves come in many variants, including, but not limited to: Weierstrass,
Montgomery, and Edwards. Each
of these variants correspond to a different category of curve equation.
For example, the short Weierstrass equation is
`y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B`. Certain encoding functions may have requirements
on the curve form, the characteristic of the field, and the parameters, such as A and B in the previous example.

An elliptic curve E is specified by its equation, and a finite field F.
The curve E forms a group, whose elements correspond to those who satisfy the
curve equation, with values taken from the field F. As a group, E has order
n, which is the number of points on the curve. For security reasons, it is a
strong requirement that all cryptographic operations take place in a prime
order group. However, not all elliptic curves generate groups of prime order.
In those cases, it is allowed to work with elliptic curves of order n = qh,
where q is a large prime, and h is a short number known as the cofactor.
Thus, we may wish an encoding that returns
points on the subgroup of order q. Multiplying a point P on E by the cofactor h
guarantees that hP is a point in the subgroup of order q.

In practice, the input of a given cryptographic algorithm will be a bitstring of
arbitrary length, denoted  {0, 1}^\*. Hence, a concern for virtually all protocols
involving elliptic curves is how to convert this input into a curve point.

Note that the number of points on an elliptic curve E is within 2\*sqrt(p) of p
by Hasse's Theorem. As a rule of thumb, for every x in GF(p), there is
approximately a 1/2 chance that there exist a corresponding y value such that
(x, y) is on the curve E. Since the point (x, -y) is also on the curve, then
this sums to approximately p points.

Ultimately, an encoding function takes a bitstring {0, 1}^\* and maps it to a
point P=(x,y) on E of order q, where x and y are in GF(p).

Summary of quantities:

| Symbol | Meaning | Relevance
|:------:|---------|----------
| p | Order of finite field, F = GF(p) | Curve points need to be represented in terms of p. For prime powers, we write F = GF(p^k).
| n | Number of curve points, #E(F) = n |  For map to E, needs to produce n elements.
| q | Order of the largest prime subgroup of E, n = qh | If n is not prime, may need mapping to q.
| h | Cofactor | For mapping to subgroup, need to multiply by cofactor.


## Terminology {#terminology}

In the following, we categorize the terminology for mapping bitstrings to
points on elliptic curves.

### Encoding {#term-encoding}

The general term "encoding" is used to refer to the process of producing an
elliptic curve point given as input a bitstring. In some protocols, the original
message may also be recovered through a decoding procedure.
An encoding may be deterministic
or probabilistic, although the latter is problematic in potentially leaking
plaintext information as a side-channel.

In most cases, the curve E is over a finite field GF(p^k), with p > 2.
Suppose as the input to the encoding function we wish to use a fixed-length
bitstring of length L. Comparing sizes of the sets, 2^L and n,
an encoding function cannot be both deterministic and bijective.

We can instead use an injective encoding from {0, 1}^L to E, with
`L < log2(n)- 1`,  which is a bijection over a subset of points in E.
This ensures that encoded plaintext messages can be recovered.

### Serialization {#term-serialization}

A related issue is the conversion of an elliptic curve point to a bitstring. We
refer to this process as "serialization", since it is typically used for
compactly storing and transporting points, or for producing canonicalized
outputs. Since a deserialization algorithm can often be used as a type of
encoding algorithm, we also briefly document properties of these functions.

A straightforward serialization algorithm maps a point (x, y) on E to a bitstring of length
2\*log(p), given that x, y are both elements in GF(p). However, since
there are only n points in E (with n approximately equal to p), it is possible
to serialize to a bitstring of length log(n). For example, one common method
is to store the x-coordinate and a single bit to determine whether the point
is (x, y) or (x, -y), thus requiring log(p)+1 bits. This method reduces storage,
but adds computation, since the deserialization process must recover the y
coordinate.

### Random Oracle {#term-rom}

It is often the case that the output of the encoding function {{term-encoding}}
should be distributed uniformly at random on the elliptic curve. That is, there
is no discernible relation existing between outputs that can be computed based
on the inputs. In practice, this requirement stems from needing a random oracle
which outputs elliptic curve points:  one way to construct this is by first
taking a regular random oracle, operating entirely on bitstrings, and applying a
suitable encoding function to the output.

This motivates the term "hashing to the curve", since cryptographic hash
functions are typically modeled as random oracles. However, this still leaves open
the question of what constitutes a suitable encoding method, which is a primary
concern of this document.

A random oracle onto an elliptic curve can also be instantiated using
direct constructions, however these tend to rely on many group operations
and are less efficient than hash and encode methods.


# Algorithm Recommendations {#recommendations}

The following table lists algorithms recommended by use-case:

| Application       | Requirement   | Additional Details
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| SPEKE {{Jablon96}}| Naive         | H(x)*G |
| PAKE  {{BMP00}}   | Random Oracle |   -    |
| BLS {{BLS01}}     | Random Oracle            |    -   |
| IBE {{BF01}}      | Random Oracle | Supersingular, pairing-friendly curve |
| PRF | Injective encoding | F(k, m) = k*H(m) |

To find the suitable algorithm, lookup the requirement from above, with
the chosen curve in the below:

| Curve  | Inj. Encoding | Random Oracle |
|--------|---------------|------|
| P-256 | Simple SWU {{simple-swu}} | FFSTV(SWU)
| P-384 | Icart {{icart}} | FFSTV(Icart)
| Curve25519 | Elligator2 {{elligator2}} | ...
| Curve448 | Elligator2 {{elligator2}} | ...

# Utility Functions {#utility}

Algorithms in this document make use of utility functions described below.

- HashToBase(x, i).
  This method is parametrized by p and H, where p is the prime order of
  the base field Fp, and H is a cryptographic hash function which
  outputs at least floor(log2(p)) + 2 bits.
  The function first hashes x, converts the result to an integer,
  and reduces modulo p to give an element of Fp. The function returns
  this element of Fp, along with an additional bit, which can be used to
  choose the sign of a point output by an encoding function.

  We provide a more detailed algorithm in {{hashtobase}}. The value of i is used
  to separate inputs when used multiple times in one algorithm (see {{ffstv}}
  for example). When i is omitted, we set it to 0.

- CMOV(a, b, c): If c = 1, return a, else return b.

- Legendre(x, p): x^((p-1)/2).
  The Legendre symbol computes whether the value x is a "quadratic
  residue" modulo p, and takes values 1, -1, 0, for when x is a residue,
  non-residue, or zero, respectively. Due to Euler's criterion, this can be
  computed in constant time, with respect to a fixed p, using
  the equation x^((p-1)/2). For clarity, we will generally prefer using the
  formula directly, and annotate the usage with this definition.

- CNEG(x, b): If b = 0, return x, else return -x.

# Deterministic Encodings

## Interface

The generic interface for deterministic encoding functions to elliptic curves is as follows:

~~~
map2curve(alpha)
~~~

where alpha is a message to encode on a curve.

## Encoding Variants

### Icart Method {#icart}

The following map2curve_icart(alpha) implements the Icart method from {{Icart09}}.
This algorithm works for any curve over F_{p^n}, where p^n = 2 mod 3
(or p = 2 mod 3 and for odd n), including:

- P384
- Curve1174
- Curve448

Unsupported curves include: P224, P256, P521, and Curve25519 since,
for each, p = 1 mod 3.

Mathematically, given input alpha, and A and B from E, the Icart method works
as follows:

~~~
(u, s) = HashToBase(alpha)
     v = ((3A - u^4) / 6u)
     x = (v^2 - B - (u^6 / 27))^(1/3) + (u^2 / 3)
     y = CNEG(ux + v, s)
~~~

The following procedure implements this algorithm in a straight-line fashion.
It requires knowledge of A and B, the constants from the curve Weierstrass form.
It outputs a point with affine coordinates.

~~~
map2curve_icart(alpha)

Input:

  alpha - value to be hashed, an octet string

Output:

  (x, y) - a point in E

Steps:

1. (u, s) = HashToBase(alpha)   // {0,1}^* -> Fp
2.     u2 = u^2 (mod p)         // u^2
3.     t2 = u2^2 (mod p)        // u^4
4.     v1 = 3 * A (mod p)       // 3A
5.     v1 = v1 - t2 (mod p)     // 3A - u^4
6.     t1 = 6 * u (mod p)       // 6u
7.     t3 = t1 ^ (-1) (mod p)   // modular inverse
8.      v = v1 * t3 (mod p)     // (3A - u^4)/(6u)
9.      x = v^2 (mod p)         // v^2
10.     x = x - B (mod p)       // v^2 - B
11.    t1 = 27 ^ (-1) (mod p)   // 1/27
12.    t1 = t1 * u2 (mod p)     // u^4 / 27
13.    t1 = t1 * t2 (mod p)     // u^6 / 27
14.     x = x - t1 (mod p)      // v^2 - B - u^6/27
15.    t1 = (2 * p) - 1 (mod p) // 2p - 1
16.    t1 = t1 / 3 (mod p)      // (2p - 1)/3
17.     x = x^t1 (mod p)        // (v^2 - B - u^6/27) ^ (1/3)
18.    t2 = u2 / 3 (mod p)      // u^2 / 3
19.     x = x + t2 (mod p)      // (v^2 - B - u^6/27) ^ (1/3) + (u^2 / 3)
20.     y = u * x (mod p)       // ux
21.     y = y + v (mod p)       // ux + v
22. Output (x, CNEG(y, s))
~~~

### Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas Method {#swu}

The Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas (SWU) method, originated in part by
Shallue and Woestijne {{SW06}} and later simplified and extended by Ulas {{SWU07}},
deterministically encodes an artbirary string to a point on a curve.
This algorithm works for any curve over F_{p^n}. Given curve equation
g(x) = x^3 + Ax + B, this algorithm works as follows:

~~~
1. (t, s) = HashToBase(alpha, 0)
2. (u, _) = HashToBase(alpha, 1)
3. X1 = u
4. X2 = (-B / A)(1 + 1 / (t^4 * g(u)^2 + t^2 * g(u)))
5. X3 = t^3 * g(u)^2  * g(X2)
6. If g(X1) is square, P = (X1, sqrt(g(X1)))
7. If g(X2) is square, P = (X2, sqrt(g(X2)))
8. Else: P = (X3(t, u), sqrt(g(X3)))
8. Output CNEG(P, s)
~~~

The algorithm relies on the following equality:

~~~
t^3 * g(u)^2  * g(X2(t, u)) = g(X1(t, u)) * g(X2(t, u)) * g(X3(t, u))
~~~

The algorithm computes three candidate points, constructed such that at least one of
them lies on the curve.

The following procedure implements this algorithm. It outputs a point with affine
coordinates. It requires knowledge of A and B, the constants from the curve
Weierstrass form.

~~~
map2curve_swu(alpha)

Input:

  alpha - value to be hashed, an octet string

Output:

  (x, y) - a point in E

Steps:

1. (t ,s) = HashToBase(alpha, 0)   // {0,1}^* -> Fp x {0,1}
2. (u, _) = HashToBase(alpha, 1)   // {0,1}^* -> Fp x {0,1}
3.   t2 = t^2
4.   t4 = t2^2
5.   gu = u^3
6.   gu = gu + (A * u)
7.   gu = gu + B      // gu = g(u)
8.   x1 = u           // x1 = X1(t, u) = u
9.   x2 = B * -1
10.  x2 = x2 / A
11.  gx1 = x1^3
12.  gx1 = gx1 + (A * x1)
13.  gx1 = gx1 + B    // gx1 = g(X1(t, u))
14.  d1 = gu^2
15.  d1 = d1 * t4
16.  d2 = t2 * gu
17.  d3 = d1 + d2
18.  d3 = d3^(-1)
19.  n1 = 1 + d3
20.  x2 = x2 * n1     // x2 = X2(t, u)
21. gx2 = x2^3
22. gx2 = gx2 + (A * x2)
23. gx2 = gx2 + B     // gx2 = g(X2(t, u))
24.  x3 = t2 * gu
25.  x3 = x3 * x2     // x3 = X3(t, u)
26. gx3 = x3^3
27. gx3 = gx3 + (A * x3)
28. gx3 = gx3 + B     // gx3 = g(X3(t, u))
29.  l1 = gx1^((p - 1) / 2)
30.  l2 = gx2^((p - 1) / 2)
31.  y1 = gx1^(1/2)
32.  y2 = gx2^(1/2)
33.  y3 = gx3^(1/2)
34. P = (x3, y3)
35. P = CMOV((x2, y2), P, l2)
36. P = CMOV((x1, y1), P, l1)
37. Output CNEG(P, s)
~~~

### Simplified SWU Method {#simple-swu}

The following map2curve_simple_swu(alpha) implements the simplfied
Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas algorithm from {{SimpleSWU}}. This algorithm
works for any curve over F_{p^n}, where p = 3 mod 4, including:

- P256
- ...

Given curve equation g(x) = x^3 + Ax + B, this algorithm works as follows:

~~~
1. (t, s) = HashToBase(alpha)
2. alpha = (-B / A) * (1 + (1 / (t^4 + t^2)))
3. beta = −t^2 * alpha
4. If g(alpha) is square, P = (alpha, sqrt(g(alpha)))
5. Else, P = (beta, sqrt(g(beta)))

### Elligator2 Method {#elligator2}

The following map2curve_elligator2(alpha) implements the Elligator2
method from {{Elligator2}}. This algorithm works for any curve
with a point of order 2 and j-invariant != 1728. Given curve equation
y^2 = x(x^2 + Ax + B), i.e., a Montgomery form with (0,0), a point of
order 2, this algorithm works as shown below. (Note that any curve
with a point of order 2 is isomorphic to this representation.)

~~~
1. (r, s) = HashToBase(alpha)
2. Let u is not a square
3. v = -A/(1+ur^ 2)
4. e = Legendre(v^3+Av^2+Bv)
5.1. If r != 0, then
5.2.    x = ev - (1 - e)A/2
5.3.    y = -e*sqrt(x^3+Ax^2+x)
5.4. Else, x=0 and y=0
6. P = (x, y)
7. Output CNEG(P, s)
~~~

Here, e is the Legendre symbol defined as in {{utility}}.

The following procedure implements this algorithm.

~~~
map2curve_elligator2(alpha)

Input:

  alpha - value to be encoded, an octet string

  u - fixed non-square value in Fp.

Output:

  (x, y) - a point in E

Steps:

1. (r,s) = HashToBase(alpha)
2.     r = r^2 (mod p)
3.    nu = r * u (mod p)
4.     r = nu
5.     r = r + 1 (mod p)
6.     r = r^(-1) (mod p)
7.     v = A * r (mod p)
8.     v = v * -1 (mod p)   // -A / (1 + ur^2)
9.    v2 = v^2 (mod p)
10.   v3 = v * v2 (mod p)
11.    e = v3 * v (mod p)
12.   v2 = v2 * A (mod p)
13.    e = v2 * e (mod p)
14.    e = e^((p - 1) / 2)  // = Legendre(e)
15.   nv = v * -1 (mod p)
16.    v = CMOV(v, nv, e)   // If e = 1, choose v, else choose nv
17.   v2 = CMOV(0, A, e)    // If e = 1, choose 0, else choose A
18.    x = v - v2 (mod p)
19     y = sqrt(x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx)
20.   Output (x, CNEG(-e*y, s))
~~~

Elligator2 can be simplified with projective coordinates.

# Random Oracles

## Interface

The generic interface for deterministic encoding functions to elliptic curves is as follows:

~~~
hash2curve(alpha)
~~~

where alpha is a message to encode on a curve.

## General Construction (FFSTV13) {#ffstv}

When applications need a Random Oracle (RO), they can be constructed from deterministic encoding
functions. In particular, let F : {0,1}^* -> E be a deterministic encoding function onto
curve E, and let H0 and H1 be two hash functions modeled as random oracles that map input
messages to the base field of E, i.e., Z_q. Farashahi et al. {{FFSTV13}} showed that the
following mapping is indistinguishable from a RO:

~~~
hash2curve(alpha) = F(H0(alpha)) + F(H1(alpha))
~~~

This construction works for the Icart, SWU, and Simplfied SWU encodings.

Here, H0 and H1 are constructed as follows:

~~~
H0(alpha) = HashToBase(alpha, 2)
H1(alpha) = HashToBase(alpha, 3)
~~~

# Curve Transformations

Every elliptic curve can be converted to an equivalent curve in short Weierstrass form
({{BL07}} Theorem 2.1), making SWU a generic algorithm that can be used for all curves.
Curves in either Edwards or Twisted Edwards form can be transformed into equivalent
curves in Montgomery form {{BL17}} for use with Elligator2.
{{RFC7748}} describes how to convert between points on Curve25519 and Ed25519,
and between Curve448 and its Edwards equivalent, Goldilocks.

# Ciphersuites

To provide concrete recommendations for algorithms we define a hash-to-curve
"ciphersuite" as a four-tuple containing:

* Destination Group (e.g. P256 or Curve25519)
* HashToBase algorithm
* HashToCurve algorithm (e.g. SSWU, Icart)
* (Optional) Transformation (e.g. FFSTV, cofactor clearing)

A ciphersuite defines an algorithm that takes an arbitrary octet string and

HashToCurve and Transformation (if defined).

This document describes the following set of ciphersuites:

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Security Considerations

Each encoding function variant accepts arbitrary input and maps it to a pseudorandom
point on the curve. Points are close to indistinguishable from randomly chosen
elements on the curve. Not all encoding functions are full-domain hashes. Elligator2,
for example, only maps strings to "about half of all curve points," whereas Icart's
method only covers about 5/8 of the points.

# Related Work {#related}

In this chapter, we  give a background to some common methods to encode or
hash to the curve, motivated by the similar exposition in {{Icart09}}.
Understanding of this material is not required in order to choose a
suitable encoding function - we defer this to {{recommendations}}
 - the background covered here can work as a template for analyzing encoding
functions not found in this document, and as a guide for further research
into the topics covered.

## Probabilistic Encoding

As mentioned in {{background}}, as a rule of thumb, for every x in GF(p), there
is approximately a 1/2 chance that there exist a corresponding y value such that
(x, y) is on the curve E.

This motivates the construction of the MapToGroup
method described by Boneh et al. {{BLS01}}. For an input message m, a counter i,
and a standard hash function H : {0, 1}^* -> GF(p) x {0, 1}, one computes (x, b)
= H(i || m), where i || m denotes concatenation of the two values. Next, test to
see whether there exists a corresponding y value such that (x, y) is on the
curve, returning (x, y) if successful, where b determines whether to take +/- y.
If there does not exist such a y, then increment i and repeat. A maximum counter
value is set to I, and since each iteration succeeds with probability
approximately 1/2, this process fails with probability 2^-I. (See {{try}} for a
more detailed description of this algorithm.)

Although MapToGroup describes a method to hash to the curve, it can also be
adapted to a simple encoding mechanism. For a bitstring of length strictly
less than log2(p), one can make use of the spare bits in order to encode
the counter value. Allocating more space for the counter increases the expansion,
but reduces the failure probability.

Since the running time of the MapToGroup algorithm depends on m,
this algorithm is NOT safe for cases sensitive to timing side channel attacks.
Deterministic algorithms are needed in such cases where failures
are undesirable.

## Naive Encoding

A naive solution includes computing H(m)\*G as map2curve(m), where H is a standard hash
function H : {0, 1}^* -> GF(p), and G is a generator of the curve. Although
efficient, this solution is unsuitable for constructing a random oracle onto
E, since the discrete logarithm with respect to G is known. For example,
given y1 = map2curve(m1) and y2 = map2curve(m2) for any m1 and m2, it must
be true that y2 = H(m2) / H(m1) * map2curve(m1). This relationship would not
hold (with overwhelming probability) for truly random values y1 and y2.
This causes catastrophic failure in many cases. However, one exception is found in
SPEKE {{Jablon96}}, which constructs a base for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange by
hashing the password to a curve point. Notably the use of a hash function is
purely for encoding an arbitrary length string to a curve point, and does not
need to be a random oracle.

## Deterministic Encoding

Shallue, Woestijne, and Ulas {{SW06}} first introduced a deterministic
algorithm that maps elements in F_{q} to a curve in time O(log^4 q), where q = p^n for
some prime p, and time O(log^3 q) when q = 3 mod 4. Icart introduced yet another
deterministic algorithm which maps F_{q} to any EC where q = 2 mod 3 in time O(log^3 q) {{Icart09}}.
Elligator (2) {{Elligator2}} is yet another deterministic algorithm for any odd-characteristic
EC that has a point of order 2. Elligator2 can be applied to Curve25519 and Curve448, which
are both CFRG-recommended curves {{RFC7748}}.

However, an important caveat to all of the above deterministic encoding functions,
is that none of them map injectively to the entire curve, but rather
some fraction of the points. This makes them unable to use to directly
construct a random oracle on the curve.

Brier et al. {{SimpleSWU}} proposed a couple of solutions to this problem, The
first applies solely to Icart's method described above, by computing F(H0(m))
+ F(H1(m)) for two distinct hash functions H0, H1. The second uses a generator
G, and computes F(H0(m)) + H1(m)\*G. Later, Farashahi et al. {{FFSTV13}}
showed the generality of the F(H0(m)) + F(H1(m)) method, as well as the
applicability to hyperelliptic curves (not covered here).

## Supersingular Curves

For supersingular curves, for every y in GF(p) (with p>3), there exists a value
x such that (x, y) is on the curve E. Hence we can construct a bijection
F : GF(p) -> E (ignoring the point at infinity). This is the case for
{{BF01}}, but is not common.

## Twisted Variants

We can also consider curves which have twisted variants, E^d. For such curves,
for any x in GF(p), there exists y in GF(p) such that (x, y) is either a point
on E or E^d. Hence one can construct a bijection F : GF(p) x {0,1} -> E ∪ E^d,
where the extra bit is needed to choose the sign of the point. This can be
particularly useful for constructions which only need the x-coordinate of the
point. For example, x-only scalar multiplication can be computed on Montgomery
curves. In this case, there is no need for an encoding function, since the output
of F in GF(p) is sufficient to define a point on one of E or E^d.

# Try-and-Increment Method {#try}

In cases where constant time execution is not required, the so-called
try-and-increment method may be appropriate. As discussion in Section {{introduction}},
this variant works by hashing input m using a standard hash function ("Hash"), e.g., SHA256, and
then checking to see if the resulting point E(m, f(m)), for curve function f, belongs on E.
This is detailed below.

~~~
1. ctr = 0
3. h = "INVALID"
4. While h is "INVALID" or h is EC point at infinity:
   A.  CTR = I2OSP(ctr, 4)
   B.  ctr = ctr + 1
   C.  attempted_hash = Hash(m || CTR)
   D.  h = RS2ECP(attempted_hash)
   E.  If h is not "INVALID" and cofactor > 1, set h = h^cofactor
5. Output h
~~~

I2OSP is a function that converts a nonnegative integer to octet string as
defined in Section 4.1 of {{RFC8017}}, and RS2ECP is a function that converts of a random
2n-octet string to an EC point as specified in Section 5.1.3 of {{RFC8032}}.

  s - a single sign bit

Steps:

  1. t1 = H("h2c" || label || I2OSP(i, 4) || x)
  2. t2 = OS2IP(t1)
  3. y = t2 (mod p)
  4. Output y
~~~

where I2OSP, OS2IP {{RFC8017}} are used to convert an octet string to and from
a non-negative integer, and a || b denotes concatenation of a and b.

### Considerations

Performance: HashToBase requires hashing the entire input x. In some
algorithms/ciphersuite combinations, HashToBase is called multiple times. For
large inputs, implementers can therefore consider hashing x before calling
HashToBase. I.e. HashToBase(H'(x)).

Most algorithms assume that HashToBase maps its input to the base field
uniformly. In practice, there will be inherent biases. For example, taking H
as SHA256, over the finite field used by Curve25519 we have p = 2^255 - 19, and
thus when reducing from 255 bits, the values of 0 .. 19 will be twice as
likely to occur. This is a standard problem in generating uniformly
distributed integers from a bitstring. In this example, the resulting bias is
negligible, but for others this bias can be significant.

To address this, our HashToBase algorithm greedily takes as many bits as
possible before reducing mod p, in order to smooth out this bias. This is
preferable to an iterated procedure, such as rejection sampling, since this
can be hard to reliably implement in constant time.

### Example configurations

The prime p = 2^255 - 19 used in Curve25519 constructions, is close to a power of 2,
and is suitable for use with both SHA256 and SHA512.

For the prime p = 2^256 - 2^224 + 2^192 + 2^96 - 1  used in P256, in order to smooth
the bias, and have enough spare bits to obtain the additional sign bit, SHA512
should be used.

For large primes with no sufficiently large output, e.g. p = 2^521 - 1 used in P-521,
we recommend extended using either extensible hash functions, or by an extract-expand
mechanism {{RFC5869}} ((TODO: Specify this precisely)).
